“Jig” is a woodworking term for a custom tool that embodies a measurement, angle, or path, making a certain kind of action repeatable.

> Woodworking jigs ensure that cuts are straight, holes are plumb and parts are square—among many other things. And jigs are worth the time it takes to make them because you’ll use them over and over again for years.
