title: Why a customer requests a feature is more valuable than What they request
categories: playbook

The customer’s _Why_ comes from their deep knowledge of the [Problem Space](https://medium.com/@nikhilgupta08/problem-space-vs-solution-space-f970d4ace5c). _What_ is a point in the Solution Space. Your map of the Solution Space is likely better than your customer’s, but their map of the Problem Space is better than yours — they _live_ there. Your ability to create value for them depends entirely on how well you can acquire their map.
