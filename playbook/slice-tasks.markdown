You're more productive doing four 1-hour tasks than one 4-hour task.

1. We are more capable of perceiving, reporting-on, and _experiencing a feeling_ of progress with smaller tasks than larger ones.
2. After slicing a larger task, we can prioritize the subtasks, and often find that some can be deferred.
3. It’s easier to attach “side quests” to larger tasks than smaller ones.
