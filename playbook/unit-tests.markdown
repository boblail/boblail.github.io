Whatever your ultimate assurance that the software works — whether end-to-end specs, desk-checking, QA, deploy-monitoring, or seeing no explosion of support calls — a suite of unit tests will finish sooner. A passing suite of unit tests won’t guarantee correctness, but a failing one catches mistakes earlier. Any mistake not caught by a unit test be costlier (by increasing cycle time on the project and potentially by impacting customers and support teams).
