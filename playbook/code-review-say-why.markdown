title: When you ask for a change during code review, explain why
categories: playbook

Doing code review, you will notice things _first_ with your gut. Dig into that feeling.

1. If you can’t explain it, don’t request a change.
2. Few engineering judgments are absolutes. Most are tradeoffs. Omitting _Why_ severs your request from its context, which presents it as an absolute. This excludes the other engineer from seeing and weighing tradeoffs as you have; it encourages them to think in terms of absolutes (which may inhibit their growth); and it discourages discussion. While the _What_ of your request may benefit the code, virtually all of the teaching, learning, and growth available to you and the other engineer is contained in the _Why._
