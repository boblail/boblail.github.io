1. Code is read more often than it is written; we gain more by optimizing for reading than for writing.
2. Code has two audiences: a compiler and humans. To the humans, it is a medium for communicating ideas about modeling, architecture, and methodology.
3. A clear purpose helps to decide what _doesn't_ belong in a function or class.

### Examples
- [Hunting for great names in programming](https://m.signalvnoise.com/hunting-for-great-names-in-programming/) lets you shadow DHH as he tries out different names for a feature in Basecamp, looking for the one that communicates his intent.
- The second chapter of _Clean Code_ (Martin) is about naming.
- Kent Beck describes the goal of his book _Implementation Patterns_ as “to help you communicate your intentions through your code.”
