Resolve or Suppress every Alert immediately.

Note: definitions of “Alert” and “immediately” may vary from team to team.

1. If you field an alert, determine it’s not urgent, and move on, then you — or a teammate — must inevitably assess it again later, doing work twice instead of building your assessment into the system (i.e. into the software, team’s policies, or alerting service).
2. If an application has a full “inbox” of Alerts, new alerts are low-signal and get detected later: which means that service is degraded longer and more time separates the troubleshooting from the initial cause.
