As you level up, it can be tempting—for many reasons—to _overengineer_ things. (You may be itching to try out a new pattern you learned or striving to “perfect” your design by accounting for _potential_ requirements.) Overengineering adds complexity which isn’t required _now._ Unnecessary complexity now makes the architecture harder to pivot later. Architectural decisions are neither right nor wrong: they’re context-bound tradeoffs. As a product changes or scales, as the team learns, architectures inevitably pivot.
