Business outcomes improve as deploys’ throughput and stability improve. (See [this report](https://cloudplatformonline.com/2018-state-of-devops-typ.html) from Google’s DevOps Research and Assessment group.) We want to increase both factors, but both hit a plateau when there is a human cost to each deploy. Throughput plateaus because individuals or companies will choose to deploy in larger batches over spending too much of a person’s time deploying. Stability plateaus when deploys rely on manual checklists or monitoring because humans error is not entirely preventable.
