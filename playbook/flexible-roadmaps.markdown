A roadmap is an inventory of decisions. Decisions have a shelf life. The more learning that is generated by the work itself, the shorter the shelf life of its plans. A good planning process incorporates this learning regularly so that milestones don’t _start_ with stale decisions. Even if it doesn’t affect the present milestone, the longer a stale decision stays on a roadmap, the harder it becomes to change since people will get used to expecting it or may create plans around it.
