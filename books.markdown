# Books I Have Known And Loved

These are the books I've read as I've looked for ways to improve my craft.
They're grouped into 8 categories:
 1. [Product Design & Discovery](#product-design--discovery)
 1. [Process, Strategy, Management](#process-strategy-management)
 1. [Frameworks for Learning & Professional Development](#frameworks-for-learning--professional-development)
 1. [Code & Architecture](#code--architecture)
 1. [Ruby & Rails](#ruby--rails)
 1. [SQL & Databases](#sql--databases)
 1. [Computer Science & Fundamentals](#computer-science--fundamentals)
 1. [My Current Reading List](#my-current-reading-list)
{: style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 15.75px"}

Within each category, the books are sorted from most valuable to least;
and I gave each an even simpler rating:

[**The Design of Everyday Things** (Norman)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654)
{: class="book-name"}

Fundamental thinking tools for designing interfaces (like the differences
between mental models the the system image; affordances, mappings, and
constraints, and forcing functions; kinds of human errors). It's also
an entertaining read â€” Norman explores his subject with a sense of
humor!

[**About Face** (Cooper, et al)](https://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/1118766571/)
{: class="book-name"}

A manual for doing Interaction Design. The first quarter
covers Product Discovery (Cooper's approach begins with
ethnographic interviews to deeply understand people's
behaviors, needs, and goals.) The remainder discusses how
inputs, persistence, error-handling, modality, and dozens
of other factors contribute to an interface's _personality_
(hopefully likable ðŸ˜„)

[**Envisioning Information** (Tufte)](https://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118)
{: class="book-name"}

A gorgeous book. While not directly concerned with Product Design,
it is a _tour de force_ of design-thinking. Tufte cross-examines
hundreds of maps, train schedules, projections, and diagrams of
every sort. He mercilessly dismisses oversimplification and
ornamentation alike in his obsession for making complexity legible.

[**Inspired** (Cagan, et al)](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507)
{: class="book-name"}

A true survey. 67 five-page chapters briefly examine the role
(and success criteria) of a Product Manager from every conceivable
angle. I got the most value from the hundred pages of techniques
starting around p160.

[**Shape Up** (Singer)](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
{: class="book-name"}

A methodology for Product Discovery and Design. I appreciated several
ideas in _Shape Up._ I love the idea of incorporating appetite (how much
time are we willing to spend on this problem?) into each business bet â€”
that's not only a way of shaping a team's choics without dictating them,
but also a way of noticing risk early! Singer also adds to the conversation
around low-fi prototyping â€” it's about more than lowering the cost of
discovery and deferring commitment on design details, it's about
_delivering_ a baseline for quality and an opportunity to unearth risks
earlier.

[**Living with Complexity** (Norman)](https://www.amazon.com/Living-Complexity-Press-Donald-Norman/dp/0262528940)
{: class="book-name"}

Reminds the reader that humans _like_ complexity â€”Â baseball would not be
"better" if it had fewer rules! Unbridled Simplicity isn't the goal
of Design, Taming Complexity is â€” the two many have a lot in common,
but we shouldn't confuse them. _Understandability_ might be a better
North Star than Simplicity.

[**Principles of Product Development Flow** (Reinertsen)](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009)
{: class="book-name"}

Thinking tools for process. The book describes 175 tactics for
optimizing things like batch size, prioritization, feedback loops,
and more. Reinertsen draws insights from fields as diverse as lean
manufacturing, economic theory, queueing theory, telecommunications,
operating system design, and maneuver warfare. For its density, it
is incredibly crisp. I literally found it exhilerating.

[**Implementing Lean Software Development** (Poppendieck)](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381)
{: class="book-name"}

Of the Poppendiecks' books on Lean Software Development, this
was the most tactical and wide-ranging. The chapter on Wastes flipped
my thinking from _optimizing_ a team's process to eliminating parts
of it altogether. When I did the Value Stream Map for one process,
the parts that needed to change were suddenly clear. I learned
to see _pull scheduling_ everywhere from this book.

[**An Elegant Puzzle** (Larson)](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186)
{: class="book-name"}

Wide-ranging, simple, direct advice on Engineering Management from
a practitioner who iterated on his approach reflectively and relentlessly.
While the physical book (from Stripe Press) is _amazing_ â€”Â with a sturdy
binding, embossed cover, heavy paper, full-color illustrations, and
attractive typography â€” it is a compilation of posts you can read for free
on Larson's site: [lethain.com](https://lethain.com/). The three (from this
book) that I found most valuable are:
[Productivity in the age of hypergrowth](https://lethain.com/productivity-in-the-age-of-hypergrowth/),
[Writing strategies and visions](https://lethain.com/strategies-visions/), and
[Migrations: the sole scalable fix to tech debt](https://lethain.com/migrations/).

[**Multipliers** (Wiseman)](https://www.amazon.com/Multipliers-Revised-Updated-Leaders-Everyone/dp/0062663070)
{: class="book-name"}

Its premise is that some leaders underutilize their teams while others
get _more_ out of people than they knew they were capable of. I thought
the Introduction felt fluffy; but by the the end of the first real chapter,
I was hooked! I got insight into several ways I could be inadvertently
limiting growth of teammates and concrete thinks to try and practice.

[**Good to Great** (Collins)](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996)
{: class="book-name"}

Lucid prose, enjoyable stories, solid read. I don't see myself _rereading_
this book, but I do find myself revisiting and applying a few vivid concepts
I learned from it: [The Hedgehog Concept](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html) and [The Flywheel](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html).

[**Peopleware** (DeMarco & Lister)](https://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-3rd/dp/0321934113)
{: class="book-name"}

This was a book I read early in my career as an Engineering Manager, and it
gave me the feeling of distilling much of what Software Engineering Management
had learned up to 1999 and handing it forward. It covers a lot of ground. It
has held up pretty well.

[**Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit** (Poppendieck)](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Software-Development-Agile-Toolkit/dp/0321150783)
{: class="book-name"}

Start with _Implementing Lean Software Development_ (above). This book,
published 3 years prior to _Implementing_ has essentially the same
content, but I found it arranged better â€”Â and expanded where I wanted
expansion in _Implementing._ That said, this book is arranged into 22
Tools to help you do things like make decisions at the last responsible
moment, ship faster, empower workers, and amplify learning.

[**The Lean Mindset** (Poppendieck)](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Mindset-Ask-Right-Questions/dp/0321896904)
{: class="book-name"}

Start with _Implementing Lean Software Development_ (above). This book is a
little more philosophical â€” "mindset" is an apt word. It attempts to capture
what a Lean Business believes at its heart about its Purpose, Workers,
Customers, the nature of Efficiency and the sources of Innovation.

[**The Pragmatic Programmer** (Thomas & Hunt)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052)
{: class="book-name"}

Organized into 46 two-to-four page chapters, early in my career
this book gave me a bunch of new ways of thinking about my craft.
When I reread it ten years later, I was stunned at how much wisdom
its authors had distilled into pithy sentences like
_Knowledge and Experience are expiring assets,
Don't Repeat Yourself,
Automate Everything,_ and
_Don't Gather Requirements, Dig for them._

[**Thinking in Bets** (Duke)](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions/dp/0735216371)
{: class="book-name"}

Every decision you make about an uncertain future (which house to buy,
which job to take, which book to read) is a bet. If you want to learn
to make better bets in the future, you look at the consequences
of your decisions; but that's immediately problematic. How much of a
good or bad outcome do you attribute to your skill (the quality of your
decision) and how much to luck (everything outside of your control)?

[**The Art of Learning** (Waitzkin)](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465)
{: class="book-name"}

Josh Waitzkin is a repeat elite performer (chess, Tai Chi, and
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu champion). This book is part autobiography
(which is entertaining) and part philosophy â€” his approach to
attaining mastery. The chapter _Making Smaller Circles,_ which is
about how Josh trains his intuition, stuck in my head.

[**Design Paradigms** (Petroski)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Paradigms-Henry-Petroski/dp/0521466490)
{: class="book-name"}

The author's premise is "The first and most indispensable design tool
is judgment. The single most important source of judgment lies in learning
from one's mistakes and those of others." Petroski expands on that
thought â€” and puts his creed into action by offering the reader case
studies of a dozen collapsed bridges and buildings, plane crashes,
and the _Challenger_ explosion.

[**Apprenticeship Patterns** (Hoover & Oshineye)](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382)
{: class="book-name"}

Thirty-five techniques for leveling up. Each describes a way you might get
stuck at some point in your career, and then shows how to overcome the
obstacle. Hoover & Oshineye describe tactics for confronting a pocket of
ignorance, leaning into strengths (and weaknesses!), self-assessing,
learning (and unlearning!), synthesizing, teaching, and finding mentors
in convential and unconventional ways. The text is fairly skimmable,
but I found it valuable just to enumerate the ways one's growth can stall
â€” and to see alternate paths forward.

[**Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests** (Freeman & Pryce)](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627)
{: class="book-name"}

A system for testing only what's necessary, for getting the right ratio
of acceptance tests to unit tests, for using mocks and stubs without
shooting your foot. The first quarter presents the system. The middle half
"shadows" the authors as they apply it in a nontrivial extended example.
I love how the authors start with first principles and quickly lay out
the _Why?_ for their system of practices.

[**A Philosophy of Software Design** (Ousterhout)](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201)
{: class="book-name"}

A quick read. Ousterhout defines the engineer's task as managing complexity.
He begins with great insights on this like _Isolating complexity where it
will rarely be seen is almost as good as eliminating it_ and _The best modules
are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations._
I appreciated the tips in "Pull Complexity Down" and "Define Errors out of
Existence" and the many concrete examples throughout. I was surprised that
he spent 21% of the book promoting comments â€” what felt apt at first eventually
felt like a soapbox. I got twice as much out of the first half as the second half.

[**Composing Software** (Elliott)](https://www.amazon.com/Composing-Software-Exploration-Programming-Composition/dp/1661212565)
{: class="book-name"}

Began with the insight that "the essence of software development
is composition", which is a two-way street for Elliott: it means
breaking complex problems into simple problems and building
complex solutions out of simple solutions (i.e.
[slicing](/2019/09/15/most-of-what-ive-learned-in-five-verbs.html#2-slicing)).
The book did not really deliver on that topic. Instead, it was
largely a primer on functional programming techniques like partial
application, currying, monads, lenses, and transducers. At that,
it did OK, but could still have benefited from a good editor.

[**Object Thinking** (West)](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David/dp/0735619654)
{: class="book-name"}

In 1972, Edsger Dijkstra diagnosed _human comprehension_ as
[the rate-limiting factor in software engineering](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html).
In that lecture, he prescribed _effective abstraction_ as our best tool
for managing software's staggering complexity.
West's Introduction starts with a similar diagnosis and a promise to teach
techniques for effective abstraction. I found _Object Thinking's_ prose
wordy; it occasionally meandered onto soapboxes; its examples were of
design-stage artifacts (I was hoping for examples of expressive code).
I don't think it delivered on its Introduction's promise.
