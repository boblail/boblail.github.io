    "Kanbans" like GitHub's Project Board and Trello have become popular. They
    are very useful for depicting the movement of tasks through a process and
    revealing backlogs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's a simple assembly line with an easy task followed by a difficult task.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <div id="process_1" class="process"></div>
    <figcaption>
      <div>Completed: <span id="process_1_completed_count">0</span></div>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Notice how the work piles up in the second Queue.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <div id="process_2" class="process"></div>
    <figcaption>
      <div>Completed: <span id="process_2_completed_count">0</span></div>
    </figcaption>

<!--

    SPECS
      - multiple processes animate on the same timer, but can be individually started and stopped
      - tasks move at an even pace but they don't take more ticks to traverse a line on a wider screen
      - a queue with a WIP Constraint is blocked when it holds that many tasks
      - a line that can't yield a task can't draw a task
      - tasks fill a queue right-to-left
      - if tasks can't physically fit in a queue, they're drawn with compression
      - there's a minimum amount of space between tasks in a queue; if tasks can't be drawn with more compression, the last tasks simply aren't drawn
      - a task is held by a worker for N ticks where N is the task's effort * the worker's rate
