      Fundamental thinking tools for designing interfaces (like the differences
      between mental models the the system image; affordances, mappings, and
      constraints, and forcing functions; kinds of human errors). It's also
      an entertaining read â€” Norman explores his subject with a sense of

      A manual for doing Interaction Design. The first quarter
      covers Product Discovery (Cooper's approach begins with
      ethnographic interviews to deeply understand people's
      behaviors, needs, and goals.) The remainder discusses how
      inputs, persistence, error-handling, modality, and dozens
      of other factors contribute to an interface's _personality_

    notes: |
      A gorgeous book. While not directly concerned with Product Design,
      it is a _tour de force_ of design-thinking. Tufte cross-examines
      hundreds of maps, train schedules, projections, and diagrams of
      every sort. He mercilessly dismisses oversimplification and
      ornamentation alike in his obsession for making complexity legible.

      A true survey. 67 five-page chapters briefly examine the role

      A methodology for Product Discovery and Design. I appreciated several
      ideas in _Shape Up._ I love the idea of incorporating appetite (how much
      time are we willing to spend on this problem?) into each business bet â€”
      that's not only a way of shaping a team's choics without dictating them,
      but also a way of noticing risk early! Singer also adds to the conversation
      around low-fi prototyping â€” it's about more than lowering the cost of
      discovery and deferring commitment on design details, it's about
      _delivering_ a baseline for quality and an opportunity to unearth risks
      earlier.

      Reminds the reader that humans _like_ complexity â€”Â baseball would not be
      "better" if it had fewer rules! Unbridled Simplicity isn't the goal
      of Design, Taming Complexity is â€” the two many have a lot in common,
      but we shouldn't confuse them. _Understandability_ might be a better
      North Star than Simplicity.

      optimizing things like batch size, prioritization, feedback loops,
      and more. Reinertsen draws insights from fields as diverse as lean
      manufacturing, economic theory, queueing theory, telecommunications,
      operating system design, and maneuver warfare. For its density, it
      is incredibly crisp. I literally found it exhilerating.

      Of the Poppendiecks' books on Lean Software Development, this
      was the most tactical and wide-ranging. The chapter on Wastes flipped
      my thinking from _optimizing_ a team's process to eliminating parts
      of it altogether. When I did the Value Stream Map for one process,
      the parts that needed to change were suddenly clear. I learned
      to see _pull scheduling_ everywhere from this book.

      Organized into 46 two-to-four page chapters, early in my career

      _Knowledge and Experience are expiring assets,
      Don't Repeat Yourself,

      Every decision you make about an uncertain future (which house to buy,
      which job to take, which book to read) is a bet. If you want to learn
      to make better bets in the future, you look at the consequences
      of your decisions; but that's immediately problematic. How much of a
      good or bad outcome do you attribute to your skill (the quality of your
      decision) and how much to luck (everything outside of your control)?

      The author's premise is "The first and most indispensable design tool

      from one's mistakes and those of others." Petroski expands on that
      thought â€” and puts his creed into action by offering the reader case
      studies of a dozen collapsed bridges and buildings, plane crashes,
      and the _Challenger_ explosion.

      Thirty-five techniques for leveling up. Each describes a way you might get
      stuck at some point in your career, and then shows how to overcome the
      obstacle. Hoover & Oshineye describe tactics for confronting a pocket of
      ignorance, leaning into strengths (and weaknesses!), self-assessing,
      learning (and unlearning!), synthesizing, teaching, and finding mentors
      in convential and unconventional ways. The text is fairly skimmable,
      but I found it valuable just to enumerate the ways one's growth can stall
      â€” and to see alternate paths forward.

      A quick read. Ousterhout defines the engineer's task as managing complexity.
      He begins with great insights on this like _Isolating complexity where it
      will rarely be seen is almost as good as eliminating it_ and _The best modules
      are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations._
      I appreciated the tips in "Pull Complexity Down" and "Define Errors out of
      Existence" and the many concrete examples throughout. I was surprised that
      he spent 21% of the book promoting comments â€” what felt apt at first eventually
      felt like a soapbox. I got twice as much out of the first half as the second half.

      Began with the insight that "the essence of software development
      is composition", which is a two-way street for Elliott: it means
      breaking complex problems into simple problems and building
      complex solutions out of simple solutions (i.e.
      [slicing](/2019/09/15/most-of-what-ive-learned-in-five-verbs.html#2-slicing)).
      The book did not really deliver on that topic. Instead, it was
      largely a primer on functional programming techniques like partial
      application, currying, monads, lenses, and transducers. At that,
      it did OK, but could still have benefited from a good editor.

      In 1972, Edsger Dijkstra diagnosed _human comprehension_ as
      [the rate-limiting factor in software engineering](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html).
      In that lecture, he prescribed _effective abstraction_ as our best tool
      for managing software's staggering complexity.
      West's Introduction starts with a similar diagnosis and a promise to teach
      techniques for effective abstraction. I found _Object Thinking's_ prose
      wordy; it occasionally meandered onto soapboxes; its examples were of
      design-stage artifacts (I was hoping for examples of expressive code).
      I don't think it delivered on its Introduction's promise.
